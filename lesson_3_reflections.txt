When would you want to create a remote repo versus keeping all of the work local?
- When you want to share your work with others.  Creating the remote repo will allow others to see your work, clone it, and contribute

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- This allows you to know what you changed since the last time you did a pull requestAnimFrame

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- Forks is a github feature to copy and change a repo when you don't have permission to change content from the owner of the repo
- clone allows you to clone a remote repo locally and work offline on your local computer
- branches allow you to make changes to code without impacting the production version, thus testing changes before merging them
